## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

# Project Idea: Co-Op Roleplaying-Game (akin to Borderlands, WoW, and D&D)

At some point, everyone has probably played a video game to some extent. Whether that’s playing Mario Kart on the couch with the kids you had to babysit or running through a World of Warcraft raid with twenty friends in your guild, we all have some kind of memorable experience with gaming. Regardless of who you are, there is probably a part of gaming that draws you in. It might be a strongly written story in a single-player game, the endless hours of fun you can have in a multiplayer game, or the unique or realistic art design.

Ideally, I would be wanting to develop some sort of roleplaying game (RPG) that takes its influence from Borderlands, World of Warcraft, and Dungeons and Dragons. Alternatively, multiplayer party games also seem to be a popular idea, so working on a something akin to Mario Party (shoutout to Douglas) or Quiplash (shoutout to Nurzhan) would also be awesome. The only limits on game design is your imagination and to an extent, the level and skillset of your character (ha it’s a gaming joke, do you get it?).

Character Bonuses:
Achievements, Multiplayer, Simplicity, Free-To-Play

Quest Items:
Unity (or some other language for games), Documentation and Design Manual, passion for gaming
